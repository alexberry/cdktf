# CDK TF Learnings

A place to play around with [terraform CDK](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf).

Start off by running through [this tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf/cdktf-install?variants=cdk-language%3Apython) to get up and running with python. Initially aim to:

* Create a docker image that can be used to execute against my code
* A make file to run the build, either with docker directly or with docker-compose
